        <h2 class="commitment">Fellow Humans;</h2>
        <h3>Belonging is the Destination, Change is the Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Three years ago we published an open letter titled <a href="https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-deciem-us-Site/en_US/Link-Page?cid=nothingchangesifnothingchanges">Nothing Changes if Nothing Changes</a>, outlining
            our commitment to fighting racial and social injustice. While DECIEM has always been committed to creating
            an equitable world of good, we viewed this initiative as a top priority after gaining a new perspective on
            the systemic injustices that exist. The realization of these inequities has inspired us to take action and
            make a positive impact. In 2021, we shared an update on our progress in, <a href="https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-deciem-us-Site/en_US/Link-Page?cid=something-changes-if-something-changes">Something Changes if Something
                Changes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last year, we spoke about how we had taken an honest look at where we could continue to improve through
            listening to our colleagues and communities with <a href="https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-deciem-us-Site/en_US/Link-Page?cid=committochange">Commit to Change,
                Change Will Come</a>. Now, we'd like to present the fourth chapter in our journey, Belonging is the
            Destination, Change is the Journey. This letter reflects our collective effort in creating a world where
            every person feels a sense of belonging. It is our hope that this work will help foster a more inclusive and
            kind world for all.
        </p>

        <!--copy-->
        <h2 class="commitment">LEARNINGS, REFLECTIONS AND<br>
            LOOKING FORWARD</h2>
        <p>
            DECIEM has undergone a transformation this year. While remaining committed to prioritizing Diversity,
            Equity, and Inclusion, we realized that our framework was missing a crucial piece - Belonging. Our Belonging
            Strategy is our roadmap to creating equitable and inclusive spaces for our teams and the communities we
            touch. Our goal: Inclusive communities where all feel accepted, appreciated, and valued for who they are; a
            world where all humans can live. We hope you’ll keep reading for details on how we plan to achieve our goal.
        </p>

        <h2 class="commitment">SAFETY TO BE OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES</h2>
        <p>
            Disrupt norms to foster a psychologically safe and inclusive environment where our DECIEM team members can
            show up as themselves and feel an authentic sense of belonging.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a safe, inclusive space where DECIEM team members can be themselves and truly belong. We believe in
            the right for every human to show up unapologetically as themselves, regardless of their background.
        </p>
        <h3>UPDATE</h3>
        <p>
            Inclusion and belonging are at the forefront of our Engagement Survey, with the 2022 results revealing that
            Inclusion ranked as our top theme. But we're not stopping there - with our Pulse Strategy, we're committed
            to measuring belonging frequently to ensure our progress continues to soar.
        </p>

        <p>
            We're committed to ongoing diversity training and education, including emotional intelligence and bias
            training for leadership through our Human Leadership program. Our 12-month program covered essential topics
            such as; self-awareness, inclusive conversations, and supporting mental health. Our CEO, Global General
            Manager and VP of People also held listening sessions with non-leadership team members to foster direct
            communication and understanding of diverse experiences within DECIEM.
        </p>
        <h3>Supporting Wellbeing:</h3>
        <p>
            We prioritize the well-being of our team through HUGS, our EAP program available to all team members and
            their families. We offer self-care activities and encourage a positive work culture that values work-life
            balance, communication, collaboration, and recognition of employee contributions. Our flexible programs
            include baby steps; bereavement, working from anywhere for four weeks, hybrid return to work, and personal
            days that can be used for anything from appointments, to self-care, to mental health days. We value
            well-being as much as our business goals - that's why we've integrated wellness and personal goals into our
            Human Enablement Program, Human Journeys.

        </p>

        <p>
            To ensure we remain focused on our commitments, we want to remind you of the goals we shared last year:
        </p>
        <ul class="commit-li">
            <li>
                <b>Maintain</b> a workforce of at least 50% BIPOC team members, focusing on Black and Indigenous peoples

                peoples &#10003;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>UPDATE</h3>
        <p>
            BIPOC leadership at DECIEM is at 55%, up from 39% in 2021. We're committed to inclusive hiring practices to
            better reflect our communities, and in the spirit of transparency, here's a breakdown of how our leadership
            team identifies:

            <b>Black Professionals in Tech Network (Obsidi):</b> DECIEM continues to commit to change, by fighting
            racial and social injustice. We have partnered with BPTN as one of the ways to align our recruitment

            team members, focusing on Black and Indigenous Peoples, and increasing representation in leadership roles.

                social and sustainable impact in all our activities. Starting from 2024, Senior Managers and above will
                have goals tied to Belonging, which will affect their personal compensation. This represents a shift in
                the way we define success to include Belonging, Sustainability, and Social Impact.
