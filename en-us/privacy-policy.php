        <h2 id="technologies">Technologies We Use</h2>
        <h3>Cookies, Web Server Logs and Web Beacons</h3>
        <p>
            Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to
            uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell
            you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain
            cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our
            Website. For details on these types of cookies and information on how to opt-out, click <a href="https://deciem.com/#show-cookiepopup">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conjunction with obtaining information through cookies, our web servers may log details such as your
            operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system
            uses and the country and time zone in which your device is located. The web server logs also may record
            information such as the address of the web page that linked you to our Website and the IP address of the
            device you use to connect to the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            To control which web servers collect this information, we may place tags on our webpages called “web
            beacons.” These are computer instructions that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>Third Party Web Analytics Services</h3>
        <p>
            We may use third party web analytics services on our Website such as Google Analytics. The service providers
            that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us
            analyze how visitors use our Website. The information collected through these means (including IP address)
            is anonymized before being shared with these service providers, who use the information to evaluate use of
            the Website. You may deactivate the ability of these analytics services to analyze your browsing activities
            on the Website. If you would like to opt-out from the use of your information by Google Analytics, you may
            use Google’s Analytics opt-out browser add-on designed for this purpose.
        </p>
        <h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>
        <p>
            We also may contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information
            through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons on our Website and emails; on third-party
            websites and emails; and on our advertising placed on third-party websites. They use this information to
            provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests (including for companies not
            affiliated with us). You may see these advertisements on our Website and other websites. This process also
            helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To not have your information shared
